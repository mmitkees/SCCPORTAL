			<p>The issue of judiciary control of the SCCOURTity of the laws in appeared 
				on the legislative and doctrine level since a long time ago.</p>
			<p>On the scholar level, the doctrine support the courts right to control the 
				SCCOURTity of the exposed laws that they can refrain to apply on the 
				standing conflict without exposing to the law itself and ruling its invalidity. 
				The first person who supported that was counselor Breton (Chief of the Mixed 
				Appeal Court. He said that during a lecture he gave with the title “the 
				Judiciary Mission in the SCCOURT Issues in the and Egypt</p>
			<p>This opinion brought out a wide doctrine argument ended when most of the 
				scholars supported the courts right to control the SCCOURTity of the 
				exposed laws by refraining leaning on the legitimate principle and to the fact 
				that this control is of the same type of the judge working. Moreover, the 
				separation among authorities principle require that, whereas few refused to 
				admit this right to the court.</p>
			<p><b>The Egyptian judiciary and the SCCOURTity control of the laws. </b>
			</p>
			<p>Upon reviewing the rulings of the Egyptian courts in the matter belongs to 
				SCCOURTity control (after the appearance of the 1971 constitution), we 
				find that the judiciary did not take a clear way to define its authority in 
				this issue.</p>
			<p><b>- The Alexandria Criminal Court ruling.</b></p>
			<p>- The SCCOURTity issue was raised for the first time, when The Alexandria 
				Criminal Court was viewing the lawsuit presented by the General prosecution 
				against Mahmoud Hassan El- Oraby, Antony Maron &amp; Others for the reason that 
				(in the period from 13<sup>th</sup> of September 1923 till the second of March 
				1924 in Alexandria and other Egyptian Cities) they spread revolutionary ideas 
				to support the change of the social basic systems …….extra. In 16<sup>th</sup> of 
				October 1924, the court decided (in the presence of the accused) jailing ruling 
				for three years according to the article 151 paragraph 2&amp;3 but the accused 
				appealed this ruling leaning on the freedom of speech right stated by article 
				14 of the constitution.</p>
			<p>
			- The Cassation Court<p>
			<p>The Cassation Court sustained the accused appeal and supported the Criminal 
				Court decision leaning on the fact that the right of freedom of speech must be 
				shaped according to the law, as article 14 of the constitution stated.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
			<p>This Judgment showed to the SCCOURT control of the laws, but it did not 
				fix this principle as a right to the courts, and it did not deny it, so it did 
				not decide in fixing this right.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
			<p><b>- The Tala First Instance Court Judgment in 1926</b></p>
			<p>In late 1925, The Minister of Zawar Pasha modified the Election Law during the 
				Parliament absence, so some mayors refused to receive election books and they 
				went on strike. The Public prosecution submitted them to trial because they 
				broke their superior’s orders according to working rules. These accused persons 
				defend themselves by saying that these rules are unSCCOURT, so their 
				refusal to apply it was not penalized action. The court decided a fine of ten 
				pounds for each of them as they broke the order.</p>
			<p>In respect to the unSCCOURT defense, the court said “The SCCOURT 
				experts agreed with…….. The ability of the courts to evaluate the 
				SCCOURTity of the laws but they have not the right to abolish these 
				unSCCOURT laws because of the separation among authorities principle. 
				The courts have the right only to refrain the application of this 
				unSCCOURT law without affecting on the existence of this law that could 
				be applied by other courts”.</p>
			<p>- This is the first judgment which applied the right of the courts to control 
				the SCCOURTity of the laws.</p>
			<p>
			- The Domestic Egyptian Court Judgment on the first of May 1941.</B< p>
			<p>This is the first judgment that founded the courts right to control the 
				SCCOURTity of the laws in open, clear and direct way leaning on some 
				reasons:<br>
				<br>
				1- The judge is bound by the local laws, when he is working to reach for his 
				decision, and he is bound by the basic law of the state, so when there is a 
				contrast between a law and the constitution, he must apply the constitution.<br>
				2- The application of this control is resulted from the separation among 
				authorities principle, so the legislative authority can not obligate the 
				judicial authority to break the rules of the constitution.</p>
			<p><b>- The Egyptian Appeal Court Judgment:</b></p>
			<p>This pioneer court was abolished by the Appeal court, which decided in the 
				session held on the 30<sup>th</sup> of May 1943, in a clear way, that the 
				courts have no right to control the SCCOURTity of the laws.</p>
			<p>-Cassation Court Judgment on the 7<sup>th</sup> of February 1957</p>
			<p>The Egyptian Cassation Court was indecisive in the SCCOURTity issue and 
				it does not cut off in an opinion till it issued a judgment, on which it 
				refrained to apply a rule on the criminal procedural law because of its 
				breaking the non- reactionary of the penal laws stated in constitution 1923.</p>
			<p>In this judgment, the court did not mention, in a clear way, that it controls 
				the SCCOURTity of the laws, but it refrained to apply the law 178 of the 
				year 1951 because of the non- reactionary rule.</p>
			<P><b>The Administrative judicial judgment in February 1948, the case number 65, year 1<sup>st</sup>:</b></P>
			<p>This judgment is the decisive in the situation of the Egyptian Courts towards 
				the right of SCCOURTity control of laws, which became without doubt one 
				of the abilities of the courts according to some reasons:<br>
				1- There are some objections in Egyptian Law for the courts to confront the 
				SCCOURTity of laws from the form or the substantive side.<br>
				2- The confrontation of the courts to the SCCOURTity of the laws is an 
				application of the separation among authorities principle and a laying down of 
				issues in its right situation.<br>
				3- The constitution authorized the judiciary system to decide on conflicts. So 
				when it faces a contrast between two rules, it must predominate one only; as 
				the contrast between a constitution and a law, it must apply the constitution 
				instead of the law that it will deny. This is not a transgression from the 
				court on the legislative power because it does not legislate the laws or decide 
				its validity and does not decide stopping its execution.</p>
			<p><b>The SCCOURTity control of laws on the legislative level</b></p>
			<p>The sequent Egyptian constitutions (from constitution 1923 till temporary 
				constitution 1964) are left the issue of SCCOURTity control of laws on 
				its determination or its objection.</p>
			<p>The SCCOURT doctrine considered the lacking of organizing the issue of 
				SCCOURTity control in the constitutions as if it is a confirmation of 
				the judicial way in this respect.</p>
			<p>The SCCOURT project 1953 (the fifty committee project):</B></p>
			<p>This is the first formal trial to organize the SCCOURTity control of laws 
				on the legislative level. After July revolution, the provision to establish “ A 
				Supreme SCCOURT Court” was stipulated in the project, which is the only 
				body responsible of the mission to control the SCCOURTity of the laws. 
				It is constituted of nine judges from counselors, law professors, and academic 
				Islamic doctrine &amp; jurors of the cassation court. The committee noticed the 
				representation of the three authorities on the form of the court. Three are 
				appointed by the State President; three are elected by the parliament in the 
				beginning of its legislative time; and three are elected by the ordinary, 
				administrative and legitimate judiciary.
			</p>
			<p>The court elects its president from its members. The presidency time is limited 
				by twelve years and it is partially renewed as the law states……….</p>
			<p>This trial is not successful because the persons who in charge of the revolution 
				refused the project of the fifty committee and entrusted some experts to 
				prepare a constitution project adjust with the revolution aims.</p>
			<p><b>The decision of the President of the Combined Arabic Republic number 81, 1969 in 
					respect of issuing the former supreme court. (1969-1979):</b></p>
			<p>This was the first trial to establish a specialized SCCOURT court, which 
				is the only responsible court of controlling the SCCOURTity of the laws. 
				It was established by the law number 81, for the year 1969 and it was 
				undertaking this mission for approx ten years (from 25<sup>th</sup> of August 
				1970 till the date of forming the current Supreme Court in 9<sup>th</sup> of 
				October 1979).</p>
			<p>The former Supreme Court was formed at the beginning of its establishment as 
				follows:</p>
			<p>- Counselor/ Badwy Ebrahim Hamouda “The first Supreme Court President”<o:p></o:p></SPAN></SPAN></p>
			<p>- The membership of counselors/ Mohamed Abd El Wahab Khalil, Omar Hafez Sherif, 
				Hussien Kassam, Hussien Zaki, Ahmed Toson Hussien, Mohamed Bahgat Atiba.</p>
			<P>The court was constituted of its President and some Vice Presidents and some 
				counselors, it was issuing the rulings by seven members.</P>
			<p>The President of The Arab Republic of Egypt appoints the Head of the Court from 
				its members. The head of the court has to be from those who have the appointed 
				provisions, without considering who reaches the retired age. The Vice 
				Presidents of the Court are appointed by the decision of the President of The 
				Arab Republic of Egypt after taking the opinion of High Council of Judicial 
				Authority. The ruling of the Court President, the Vice Presidents and the 
				Counselors lasts for three years and could be renewed.</p>
			<p>Former Supreme Court Jurisdictions:<br>
				1- To rule the SCCOURTity of the laws.<br>
				2- To interpret the legal provisions.<br>
				3- To stop the execution of the arbitral awards in the governmental and public 
				sector conflicts.<br>
				4- To decide on the jurisdiction litigation.</p>
			<p><b>The Constitution 1971:</b></p>
			<P>The Constitution 1971 considered to be the first constitution, which organized 
				the SCCOURT control over laws and regulations. It assigned this control 
				to the “ Current SCCOURT Court” as an independent judiciary system in 
				the articles 174 till 178.</P>
			<p>The constitution considered the “ Current SCCOURT Court” as the only 
				judiciary system, that is responsible for controlling the SCCOURTity of 
				the laws and regulations, and interpreting the legal provisions. The 
				constitution referred to the law of the court in organizing the rest of its 
				jurisdictions, its form and rulings, its issues and its sequences.</p>
			<p>The law number 48, for 1979 concerning the releasing of the “ Supreme 
				SCCOURT Court” organizes the deeds of the court, its jurisdictions and 
				all its related matters. Article 8 of the law stipulates that without violating 
				article 2 of the law, the law number 81, for 1969 was cancelled, procedural and 
				duty law number 66, for1970 and the law number 79, for 1976 concerning some 
				rules of the High Court and it also stipulates canceling all provisions, which 
				are different from this law. On these grounds, the Supreme SCCOURT Court 
				became the one and only judiciary system, which is specialized in controlling 
				the SCCOURTity of the laws in Egypt</p>
